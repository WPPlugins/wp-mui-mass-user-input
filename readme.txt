== Description ==

WP-MUI (Mass User Entry) allows a WordPress blog administrator to quickly create new users in the WordPress user database. 
Data entry could be done solely using the keyboard. Various AJAX functions assist you by validating data on the fly. 
Additionally, there are functions for automatically generating usernames and passwords.
Emails can be sent automatically to new users with their login information. 
Administrators can specify the minimum user-level requirement for managing the plugin on the General Settings page.
Lastly, you will be able to export all your users into a CSV file that can include addresses, phone numbers, and more.

== Installation ==

1. Upload all the files into your wp-content/plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page
